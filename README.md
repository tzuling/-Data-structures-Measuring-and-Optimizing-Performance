# Data-structures-Measuring-and-Optimizing-Performance

Hello there!
This repository holds my programming projects done during the course on Coursera. Here's the link bellow:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance

In this course, you will use and analyze data structures that are used in industry-level applications, such as linked lists, trees, and hashtables.  You will explain how these data structures make programs more efficient and flexible.  You will apply asymptotic Big-O analysis to describe the performance of algorithms and evaluate which strategy to use for efficient data retrieval, addition of new data, deletion of elements, and/or memory usage.
